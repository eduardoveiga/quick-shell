#Quick-shell

This is a quick bash profile.
Nothign crazy, just enough to get you going.
Possibly on a temporary machine, or VM, or even drunk in a hotel.


## Usage

Git is required, duh

```bash
git clone github.com/mhartington/quick-shell.git
cd quick-shell
./quick-shell.sh install
```

Quit your terminal and start it up again, then you are good to go.

Only works in bash right now, but I may do zsh later on.
